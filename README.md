# Quality Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the material developed for a two-phase quality data analysis project based on image-derived features from 3D-printed components.  
The goal is to explore the data, extract meaningful features, and apply statistical methods to detect potential defects.

## 📁 Notebooks

The project includes two main notebooks:

- **Phase I**
- **Phase II**

Each phase is provided in **two formats**:

- `.ipynb` — editable Jupyter Notebook  
- `.html` — static version for quick viewing without running code  

Both notebooks are **fully self-explanatory** and include all steps:
- data loading and preprocessing  
- exploratory analysis  
- feature extraction  
- statistical modeling  
- defect detection logic  
- visual outputs and interpretations  

No additional documentation is required to understand or reproduce the workflow.

## ▶️ How to Use

Simply open the HTML or IPYNB versions to read the analysis.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

- Phase_I.ipynb
- Phase_I.html
- Phase_II.ipynb
- Phase_II.html


## ✔️ Notes

- The notebooks are self-contained and guide the reader through the entire analytical process.
